# Introduction

A data analysis tool for the Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law that proactively and automatically identifies individuals who are eligible for re-sentencing in California's prison system.

# Background

The Three Strikes Project is legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Lawyers assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor-Initiated Resentencing.
