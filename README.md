# Introduction

A data analysis tool for the Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law that proactively and automatically identifies non-violent offendors in California's prison system who are eligible for re-sentencing. 

# Background

The Three Strikes Project is legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Lawyers assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor Initiated Resentencing (PIR).

But, given that there are over 100,000 people in California's prisons, lawyers need efficient and accurate ways to identify those who are eligible for PIR instead of manually reviewing piles of paperwork. Redo.io is solving this problem with an open-source eligibility tool for lawyers to filter their caseload and apply their expertise efficiently. We are currently under a contract with the Stanford School of Law to develop this application.

## Summary 

What it is:
- A deterministic model with a rules-based framework established by legal experts and District Attorney offices
- Easily interpretable and explainable for non-technical users and audience
- Responsive to user requests, i.e. an attorney can request changes to the eligibility criteria and see updated results
- A tool that increases the efficiency and productivity of attorneys

What it is not:
- A blackbox prediction model
- The decision-maker for which cases are ultimately resentenced

## Execution

Running the model for the prison population:
- Leverage an AWS EC2 instance on Stanford secure servers
- Ingest all of the demographics and offenses of individuals in California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) custody
- Execute the eligibility model
- Provide attorneys easy-to-understand profiles of eligible individuals
- Re-run when new data on the population is available from the District Attorney's office

# Data 

The raw data for the model comes from the Three Strikes Project and the participating District Attorney offices. We utilize the following information on the prison population from these datasets:

## (a). Current commitments<br>
Information on an invidual's offenses that they are currently serving time for.

### Variables<br>
`CDCR #`: Universal identification across datasets<br>
`Sentencing County`: District Attorney Office or location<br>
`Case Number`: Case identification<br>
`Offense`: Penal code number<br>
`Offense Category`: Nature of offense<br>
`Offense Begin Date`: Date when offense was committed<br>
`Enhancements`: Additional charges added to individual's record<br>
### Note<br>
Each row will include the details on ONE offense committed by the individual, i.e. if an individual has committed 6 offenses under 2 separate case numbers, there will be 6 rows in total associated with their CDCR identification number.
### Further details<br>
`Relationship` variable specifies the nature of a sentence and takes the following values: 'Initial', 'Concurrent', 'Consecutive' or 'Stayed'<br>
`In-prison` variable specifies if an offense was committed in prison or not and takes the following values: 'Yes' or 'No'

## (b). Prior commitments<br>
Information on an invidual's offenses that they are no longer serving time for.

### Variables<br>
`CDCR #`: Universal identification across datasets<br>
`Sentencing County`: District Attorney Office/Location<br>
`Case Number`: Case identification<br>
`Offense`: Penal code number<br>
`Offense Category`: Nature of offense<br>
`Offense Begin Date`: Date when offense was committed<br>
### Note<br>
Each row will include the details on ONE offense committed by the individual, i.e. if an individual has committed 6 offenses under 2 separate case numbers, there will be 6 rows in total associated with their CDCR identification number.
### Further details<br>
`Relationship` variable specifies the nature of a sentence and takes the following values: 'Initial', 'Concurrent', 'Consecutive' or 'Stayed'<br>
`In-prison` variable specifies if an offense was committed in prison or not and takes the following values: 'Yes' or 'No'

## (c). Demographics<br>
Personal information on the individual.

### Variables<br>
`CDCR #`: Universal identification across datasets<br>
`Birthday`: Individual's date of birth<br>
`Offense Begin Date`: Date when offense was committed<br>
`Aggregate Sentence in Months`: Total sentence length in months<br>
