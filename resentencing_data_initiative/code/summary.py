    Parameters
    ----------
    cdcr_nums : list of strs
        List of CDCR numbers to generate population summary for
    demographics : pandas dataframe
        Data on demographics of the incarcerated population
    current_commits : pandas dataframe
        Data on current offenses of the incarcerated population wherein each row contains a single offense
    prior_commits : pandas dataframe
        Data on prior offenses of the incarcerated population wherein each row contains a single offense
    merit_credit : pandas dataframe
        Data on education credits attained during incarceration
    milestone_credit : pandas dataframe
        Data on rehabilitation milestones attained during incarceration
    rehab_credit : pandas dataframe
        Data on credits received from institution for participating in rehabilitative programs
    voced_credit : pandas dataframe
        Data on credits received from institution for participating in vocational training programs
    rv_report : pandas dataframe
        Data on rules violations during incarceration
    read_path : str, optional
        Full path from where input data is read (all parent folders)
        Default is None.
    id_label : str
        Name of CDCR ID column in the data
    clean_col_names : boolean, optional
        Specify whether to clean column names before running the eligibility model. Applies the utils.clean() function on the column headers
        Default is True
    county_name : str, optional
        Name of the county for which eligibility was evaluated, ex: 'Los Angeles County'
        Default is None.
    month : str, optional
        Year and month for which eligibility was evaluated, ex: '2023_06'
        Default is None.
    pop : str, optional
        Nature of the population being evaluated, ex: 'adult' or 'juvenile'
        Default is none
    to_excel : boolean, optional
        Specify whether to write the summaries of eligible individuals to Excel files.
        If True, specify the path information to write the output
        Default is False.
    write_path : str, optional 
        Specify the full path where the Excel outputs should be written. 
        If to_excel = True but write_path = None, data outputs are written to the county_name/month/output/date folder by default. To avoid this behavior, pass a value to write_path.
    
    Returns
    -------
    df : pandas dataframe
        Data on convictions, rules violations, programming for each CDCR number passed in the input dataframe. If merge = True, this includes the input dataframe as well
