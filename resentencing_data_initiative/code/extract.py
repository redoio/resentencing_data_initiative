    Parameters
    ----------
    read_path : str
        Full path of the file to extract data from (all parent folders)
    county_name : str
        Name of the county folder to extract data for, ex: 'Los Angeles County'
        Becomes a part of the file path
    month : str
        Year and month for which data should be extracted, ex: '2023_06'
    count : int
        Number of inputs to extract, i.e. number of times to call the extract_data() function
    write_path : str, optional 
        Specify the path where the pickle outputs should be written. 
        If pickle = True but write_path = None, data outputs are written to the county_name folder by default. To avoid this behavior, pass a value to write_path.
    pickle: boolean, optional
        Specify whether to store dataframe output as a pickle file or not
        Default is False.
