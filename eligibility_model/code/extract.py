    Parameters
    ----------
    main_path : str
        Folder path of the file to extract data from (all parent folders without county name, month and file name)
    county_name : str
        Name of the county folder to extract data for, ex: 'Los Angeles County', that becomes a part of the file path
    file_convention : str
        Name of the .txt file from which the naming conventions should be extracted. Must be formatted as a numerical list with file names enclosed in single quotes, ex: "1. 'commitments.xlsx'"
        File extension of .txt should be included
    ext : str
        File extension of the file names to be checked, ex: '.xlsx', '.csv' etc. 
        Default is '.xlsx'
    month : str
        Year and month for which data should be extracted, ex: '2023_06'
    count : int
        Number of inputs to extract, i.e. number of times to call the extract_data() function
    write_path : str, optional 
        Specify the path where the pickle outputs should be written. 
        If pickle = True but write_path = None, data outputs are written to the county_name folder by default. To avoid this behavior, pass a value to write_path.
    pickle: boolean, optional
        Specify whether to store dataframe output as a pickle file or not
        Default is False.
